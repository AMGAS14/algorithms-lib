A algorithms library in java


Algorithms playground for common questions solved in java.
In case you want to prepare yourself for a job interview - try to solve it yourself first, then have a look here.


Topics we will be covered in this library include:

Network flows (max flow and min-cost flow/circulation)
Data structures (fibonacci heaps, splay trees, dynamic trees)
Linear programming (structural results, algorithms)
Dealing with intractability: approximation algorithms (techniques for design and analysis)
Dealing with large data sets (compression, streaming algorithms, compressed sensing)
Computational geometry
