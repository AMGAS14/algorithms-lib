# algorithms-lib
A algorithms library in java


## Library Description

The need for efficient algorithms arises in nearly every area of computer science. But the type of problem to be solved, the notion of what algorithms are "efficient,'' and even the model of computation can vary widely from area to area. In this library , we will survey many of the techniques that apply broadly in the design of efficient algorithms, and study their application in a wide range of application domains and computational models.

### This is a tentative list of topics that we wish be covered in the library.


**Network flows** 
(max flow and min-cost flow/circulation)

**Data structures** 
(fibonacci heaps, splay trees, dynamic trees)

**Linear programming** 
(structural results, algorithms)

**Dealing with intractability:** 
approximation algorithms (techniques for design and analysis)

**Dealing with large data sets** 
(compression, streaming algorithms, compressed sensing)
